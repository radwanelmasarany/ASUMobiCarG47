## Our Project:
**This project is supervised by Dr Mohamed Sobh ( Ain shams university- 2nd electrical engineering- control course).**

MobiCar allows complete mobile control over cars using
bluetooth signal. MobiCar is equipped with mini computer, sensors and actuators in additional to
reliable mechanical system and attractive frame.
### Mobicar Hardware:
MobiCar hardware is equipped with arduino controller to make it
easier for programming. The communication is provided via
bluetooth module. The USB port is used for battery charging and
programming. The driving motor is controlled by H-Bridge
module to control the velocity. The steering mechanism is
controlled by a servo module.
### Mobicar Software:
MobiCar provided with a set of mobile applications to submit basic control,
issue and replay a sequence of commands, program car actions using blockly
language, move the car in a fixed or custom paths, move the car in augmented
reality environment.
### Project goals:
This project contains 3 phases & a bonus phase
(Easy Driving Application-Line Tracking Application-Accurate Movement Application-Advanced Applications in addition to the competition).


At the end of this project we will record a demo video illustrating all car applications and upload it to Youtube


**Phase 1 :Easy Driving Application:**
- User should  submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in easy driving mode.
- User can control car movement using mobile.
- User can move the car forward, backward, left and right.
- The car should avoid obstacles.

**Phase 2 :Line Tracking Application:**
- prepare set of connected white sheets (2m x 2m) and draw track over it.
- User submit Bluetooth command to put the car in line tracking mode.
- When the car placed over the track it should follow the line.

**Phase 3 :Accurate Movement Application:**
- User should submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in accurate movement mode.
- User can order the car to move forward or backward for certain length.
- User can order the car to move right with proper angle.
- While demo the car should move in infinity shape then rectangle shape then circle shape.
- The car should stop for 25 seconds after finishing each shape.
